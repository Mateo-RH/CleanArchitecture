## Notes

**Clean Architecture** it's basically defining boundaries that separete the business policies from the details. and in order to cross those boundaries you have to control the dependencies to ensure that de business never depend on the detail.

- i tried to apply all the principles but with functional programming, it would be nice to refactor all this to poo and apply the patterns there.
